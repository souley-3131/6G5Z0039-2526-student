## Create Singletons representing Currencies

````java
public class Currency {
    final static char POUND_SYMBOL = '£';
    final static char DOLLAR_SYMBOL = '$';
    final static char EURO_SYMBOL = '€';

    public final static Currency GBP = new Currency("GBP", "British Pound", POUND_SYMBOL, 2);
    public final static Currency USD = new Currency("USD", "US Dollar",DOLLAR_SYMBOL, 2);
    public final static Currency EUR = new Currency("EUR", "Euro",EURO_SYMBOL, 2);

    private final String code;
    private final String name;
    private final char symbol;
    private final int  decimals;

    private Currency(String code, String name, char symbol, int decimals) {
        this.code = code;
        this.name = name;
        this.symbol = symbol;
        this.decimals = decimals;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public char getSymbol() {
        return symbol;
    }
    public int getDecimals() {
        return decimals;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (!(o instanceof Currency currency)) return false;
        return  code.equalsIgnoreCase(currency.code) &&
                name.equalsIgnoreCase(currency.name) &&
                (symbol == currency.symbol) &&
                (decimals == currency.decimals);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(code, name, symbol, decimals);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%s (%s)",code, symbol);
    }
}
````

Note the more complex implementation of the `equals` method and the use of `Objects.hash` to compute a hash code from multiple fields.

In this example, Currencies are something that will remain constant through the lifetime of the program, and therefore we only want to create a single instance.

The name for an single instance is **Singleton**. There are several ways of creating a Singleton, but this lab shows the most common, that of making a final static instance.

Note that in the implementation code, the constructor is private, so that client code is forced to use one of the singleton instances - it cannot create its own instances.

Why is it important that any Singletons are final and immutable? because the singleton has global scope across the whole program. If you could change the value of a singleton, it could potentially break everywhere the singleton is used.

## Write a Money Factory using the Abstract Factory pattern.

First we need a Money class conforming to the Value Object pattern.

```java
public class Money {

    private final double amount;
    private final Currency currency;

    public Money(double amount, Currency currency) {
        this.currency = currency;
        double factor = Math.pow(amount, currency.getDecimals());
        this.amount = Math.round(amount * factor)/factor; //round to the number of currency decimals
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public Currency getCurrency() {
        return currency;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (!(o instanceof Money money)) return false;
        return (amount == money.amount)  && currency.equals(money.currency);
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(amount, currency);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        //create a format string such as ".2f" to display a double to a number of decimals
        String formatString = String.format(".%df", currency.getDecimals());
        return currency.getSymbol() + String.format("%" + formatString , amount);
    }
}
```

The factory interface is simple.

```java
interface MoneyFactory {
    Money create(double amount);
}
```

Example concrete implementation.

```java
class EurMoneyFactory implements MoneyFactory{

    @Override
    public Money create(double amount) {
        return new Money(amount, Currency.EUR);
    }
}
```

If we pass the factory interface into a program, the choice of concrete implementation determines which currency the program will work in.

For example, the createMoney method will create money of various currencies, depending on which concrete factory was passed in.

```java
public final class Example {

    public static void run() {
        createMoney(new EurMoneyFactory());
        createMoney(new UsdMoneyFactory());
        createMoney( new GbpMoneyFactory());
    }

    private static void createMoney(MoneyFactory moneyFactory) {
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyFactory.create(10d));
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyFactory.create(10.9999d));
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyFactory.create(0.9999d));
    }
}
```
## Write a Money Creator using a Factory Method

This is a very similar factory implementation, using an abstract base class rather than an interface.

```java
abstract class AbstractMoneyCreator {
    public Money create(double value){

        //Can add code before or after the factory method
        System.out.format("requested Money with value %f%n", value);
        Money money =  factoryMethod(value);
        System.out.format("created  %s%n", money);
        return money;
    }

    protected abstract Money factoryMethod(double value);
}
```

The key difference between the FactoryMethod and AbstractFactory patterns is that the `create` method delegates the work of actually creating the object to an `abstract factoryMethod` method, which is implemented by the various subclasses of `AbstractMoneyCreator`.

This means that you can add code before and after the call that creates the object as required.

An example sublcass providing a concrete implementation of the abstract factoryMethod.

```java
class UsdMoneyCreator extends AbstractMoneyCreator {

    @Override
    protected Money factoryMethod(double value) {
        return new Money(value, Currency.USD);
    }
}
```

The usage is very similar to the AbstractFactory example

```java

public final class Example {

    public static void run() {
        createMoney(new EurMoneyCreator());
        createMoney(new UsdMoneyCreator());
        createMoney( new GbpMoneyCreator());
    }

    private static void createMoney( AbstractMoneyCreator moneyCreator) {
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyCreator.create(10d));
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyCreator.create(10.9999d));
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyCreator.create(0.9999d));
    }
}

```

Which is the better pattern to use - as ever it depends on the situation, the abstract creator version allows for some code to run before or after the object creation. The drawback is that all subclasses will have the same before and after code run, which may or may not be what is required.

A better solution is to combine both patterns, and use the abstract base class when there is some genuine implementation reuse needed - this gives you the most reuse and the most flexibility.

The client uses the MoneyFactory interface

```java
interface MoneyFactory {
    Money create(double amount);
}
```

We now can create an abstract base class and use the FactoryMethod pattern when it suits our purposes, or just write another concrete implementation of the MoneyFactory interface when we don't want to use the FactoryMethod pattern.

```java

abstract class AbstractMoneyCreator implements MoneyFactory {
    public Money create(double value){

        //Can add code before or after the factory method
        System.out.format("requested Money with value %f%n", value);
        Money money =  factoryMethod(value);
        System.out.format("created  %s%n", money);
        return money;
    }

    protected abstract Money factoryMethod(double value);
}
```

The example reverts back to using the MoneyFactory interface,

```java
public final class Example {

    public static void run() {
        createMoney(new EurMoneyCreator());
        createMoney(new UsdMoneyCreator());
        createMoney(new GbpMoneyCreator());

    }

    private static void createMoney(MoneyFactory moneyFactory) {
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyFactory.create(10d));
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyFactory.create(10.9999d));
        System.out.format("%s%n", moneyFactory.create(0.9999d));
    }
}
```


# Summary

The word **factory** tends gets used to mean any mechanism for creating an instance other than directly using a **class instance creation expression**, which in Java is the `new` keyword.

## static Helper Methods

A static helper method that creates and returns an instance of a class as either a concrete type or an abstract type (abstract class or interface type).

Reasons for doing this

- providing a better named method than the constructor for example `of`, `parse`, `fromString(String s)`,`fromInteger(int i)`.
- having two methods with the same parameter types, for example create a Rectangle from either `double width, double height` and `double width, double aspectRatio`.
- hiding complex logic required before creating an instance that shouldn't be in the class constructor (string parsing being an example)
- returning instances of different concrete types via an abstract type depending on the parameters passed to the method (this is a parameterized factory).
- returning null to indicate the instance could not be created rather than throwing an exception.

## Abstract Factory

Just like we can put different but related algorithms into different classes but implementing the same interface (Strategy Pattern), we can put different but related object creation code into different classes implementing the same abstract factory interface.

Now by choosing which concrete implementation of the abstract factory interface to use at runtime, we can vary what instance construction code gets used. You chose the concrete implementation of the abstract factory interface once, and that choice is used every time objects are created using the factory interface.

- The abstract factory interface can return concrete types or abstract types (interface or abstract class type).
- Furthermore, a single abstract factory interface can have multiple methods, so that your choice of concrete implementation control the construction of multiple related objects (we call this a family of related types because they vary together).

For example, take an Ecommerce order. We might want to use a different payment service and different shipping provider depending on the country the order is being shipped to.

Start with the two payment gateway and shipping provider interfaces.

```java
public interface PaymentService {
    boolean processPayment(double amount);
}
```

```java
public interface ShippingService {
    void ship(String orderId);
}
```

Create two concrete implementations of the Payment Service interface, one to use if ship to UK, one if ship to Europe.

```java

public class UkPayment implements PaymentService {
    @Override
    public boolean processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("UK payment processing...");
        return true;
    }
}

public class EurPayment implements PaymentService {
    @Override
    public boolean processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("EU payment processing...");
        return true;
    }
}
```
Create two concrete implementations of the Shipping Service interface, one to use if ship to UK, one if ship to Europe.

```java
public class UkShipping implements ShippingService {
    @Override
    public void ship(String orderId) {
        System.out.println("Shipping order to UK" + orderId + " (domestic)");
    }
}
```

```java
public class EurShipping implements ShippingService {
    @Override
    public void ship(String orderId) {
        System.out.println("Shipping order to EUR " + orderId + " (european)");
    }
}
```

In this scenario we want the concrete implementations of PaymentService and ShippingService vary *together* depending on the shipping destination.

We define an abstract factory interface to create both services.

```java
public interface EcommerceFactory {
    PaymentService createPaymentService();
    ShippingService createShippingService();
}
```

We can now create two concrete implementations of the EcommerceFactory interface, one for UK orders, one for European orders.

```java
// UkEcommerceFactory.java
public class UkEcommerceFactory implements EcommerceFactory {
    @Override
    public PaymentService createPaymentService() {
        return new UkPayment();
    }
    @Override
    public ShippingService createShippingService() {
        return new UkShipping();
    }
}

// EurEcommerceFactory.java
public class EurEcommerceFactory implements EcommerceFactory {
    @Override
    public PaymentService createPaymentService() {
        return new EurPayment();
    }
    @Override
    public ShippingService createShippingService() {
        return new EurShipping();
    }
}
```
My Ecommerce Order class now uses the EcommerceFactory interface to create and use the payment and shipping services.

```java
class Order {
    private final PaymentService paymentService;
    private final ShippingService shippingService;

    public Order(EcommerceFactory factory) {
        this.paymentService = factory.createPaymentService();
        this.shippingService = factory.createShippingService();
    }

    public void processOrder(String orderId, double amount) {
        if (paymentService.processPayment(amount)) {
            shippingService.ship(orderId);
        }
    }
}
```

When I create the Order I just need to pass in the correct concrete implementation of the EcommerceFactory interface depending on the shipping destination.

```java
EcommerceFactory factory;
if (shippingCountry.equals("UK")) {
    factory = new UkEcommerceFactory();
} else {
    factory = new EurEcommerceFactory();
}
Order order = new Order(factory);
order.processOrder("ORDER123", 100.00);
```

If later on we want to add support for US orders, we just need to create a new concrete implementation of the EcommerceFactory interface, and the corresponding PaymentService and ShippingService implementations.

```
EcommerceFactory factory;
if (shippingCountry.equals("UK")) {
factory = new UkEcommerceFactory();
} else if (shippingCountry.equals("US")) {
factory = new UsEcommerceFactory(); //NEW FACTORY FOR NEW DESTINATION
} else {
factory = new EurEcommerceFactory();
}
Order order = new Order(factory);
order.processOrder("ORDER123", 100.00);
```

## Factory Method Pattern

Factory Method pattern uses an abstract base class with a concrete method that creates an object, but delegates the actual object creation to an abstract method that is implemented by subclasses.
This allows the abstract base class to run code before and after the object creation, while allowing subclasses to vary the actual object that is created.

# Using the Abstract Factory Pattern to create different Iterators
We previously introduced the Java Iterable and Iterator Interfaces as a standard way of providing an iterator for a collection. The Iterable interface has a single method `iterator()` that returns an Iterator, and the Iterator interface has methods `hasNext()` and `next()` to access the elements of the collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

If we want to provide different iterators for the same collection, we can use the Abstract Factory pattern to create different iterators. We need to use a Factory because the definition of the Iterable<T> interface is that it creates and returns an new instance of Iterator<T> when the `iterator()` method is called, so we need to use a Factory to create the different iterators.

Now the concrete implementation of the Factory is the thing that provides the different iterators, and the client code just uses the Iterable interface to get an iterator, without needing to know which concrete implementation of the Factory is being used.

For example, in the Game we might want to provide different iterators over a collection of Players. In this case the iterator is selecting the next player to take their turn, so we might want to have a different iterator for different game modes. For example, in a "normal" game mode we might want to iterate over the players in the order they were added to the game, but in a "random" game mode we might want to iterate over the players in a random order. In our implementation of iterators the sequence never stops, the next() method keeps providing players in order.

We start with a simple `Player` class.

```java
class Player {
    private final String color;
    private final String name;

    Player(String name, String color) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(name);
        Objects.requireNonNull(color);
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```
The `PlayerIteratorFactory` interface is the abstract factory that creates the different iterators for array of players.

```java
interface PlayerIteratorFactory {
    Iterator<Player> create(Player... players);
}
```
The `PlayerIterable` class implements `Iterable<Player>`.

It has a constructor that takes a `PlayerIteratorFactory` and an array of `Player`s, and the `iterator()` method uses the factory to create and return an new instance of an iterator over the players every time the `iterator()` method is called.

We need to create a new iterator every time the `iterator()` method is called because the state of the iterator (the current position in the collection) is maintained in each iterator instance, so we can't reuse the same iterator instance for multiple iterations.

```java
class PlayerIterable implements Iterable<Player> {

    private final Player[] players;
    private final PlayerIteratorFactory factory;

    public PlayerIterable(PlayerIteratorFactory factory, Player... players) {
        this.factory = factory;
        this.players = players;
    }

    @Override
    public Iterator<Player> iterator() {
        return factory.create(players);
    }
}
```

We can now create our Factories and their corresponding iterators. We are going to make factories for **forward** (players take turns in the order they were added to the game), **reverse** (players take turns in the reverse order they were added to the game) and **random** (players take turns in a random order) play.

All three iterators are implemented as private inner classes, but they could be implemented as separate package private or public classes if desired. All the concrete implementations all share some elements of common code, and these common code elements have been generalized into abstract super classes.


```java
//All selector implementations share the same code for storing the players and counting them, so we put that in an abstract class.
abstract class AbstractSelector {
    protected final Player[] players;

    protected AbstractSelector(Player[] players) {
        this.players = Arrays.copyOf(players, players.length);
    }

    int count() {
        return players.length;
    }
}
```
The forward and reverse iterators are similar in that they use a simple index to keep track of the current position in the collection, so we can put that common code in an abstract class.

```java
// An abstract selector that uses an index to select players in a cyclic manner using the % modulo operator.
abstract class IndexedSelector extends AbstractSelector implements Iterator<Player> {

    private int index = 0;

    public IndexedSelector(Player... players) {
        super(players);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public Player next() {
        return players[index++ % count()];
    }
}
```

The ForwardSelector is a simple extension of the IndexedSelector, and is created as a private inner class in the factory method. The 'static' modifier means that the ForwardSelector class does not have access to the instance variables of the ForwardSelectorFactory class, but it can still be instantiated and used by the factory method.

```java
class ForwardSelectorFactory implements PlayerIteratorFactory {

    // A private static class that extends IndexedSelector.
    // As it is private the only way to create an instance of it is through the create method of the PlayerIteratorFactory interface.
    // ForwardSelector simply iterates through the players in the order they were provided.
    private static class ForwardSelector extends IndexedSelector {
        public ForwardSelector(Player... players) {
            super(players);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Iterator<Player> create(Player... players) {
        return new ForwardSelector(players);
    }
}
```

The ReverseSelector is a slightly more complex extension of the IndexedSelector, and is again created as a private inner class in the factory method.

```java
class ReverseSelectorFactory implements PlayerIteratorFactory {
    // A private static class that extends IndexedSelector.
    // As it is private the only way to create an instance of it is through the create method of the PlayerIteratorFactory interface.
    // ReverseSelector simply iterates through the players in the reverse of the order they were provided.
    // We only want to perform the reversal once, so we do it in the constructor.
    private static class ReverseSelector extends IndexedSelector {

        public ReverseSelector(Player... players) {
            for (int i = 0, j = players.length - 1; i < j; i++, j--) {
                Player swap = players[i];
                players[i] = players[j];
                players[j] = swap;
            }
            super(players);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public Iterator<Player> create(Player... players) {
        return new ReverseSelector(players);
    }
}
```

The RandomSelector is also created as a private inner class in the factory method.

```java
class RandomSelectorFactory implements PlayerIteratorFactory {
    // A private static class that extends AbstractSelector and implements Iterator<Player>
    // As it is private the only way to create an instance of it is through the create method of the PlayerIteratorFactory interface.
    // Randomly selects a random player using the Java Random class to select a number between 0 inclusive and count() exclusive.
    private static class RandomSelector extends AbstractSelector implements Iterator<Player> {
        private final Random random = new Random();

        public RandomSelector(Player... players) {
            super(players);
        }

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            return true;
        }

        @Override
        public Player next() {
            return players[random.nextInt(0, count())];
        }
    }


    @Override
    public Iterator<Player> create(Player... players) {
        return new RandomSelector(players);
    }
}
```

The `Game` class uses the standard Java `Iterable<Player>` class to get an iterator over the players, the Java language enhanced for loop (the `for-each` loop) is used to iterate over the players.

```java
class Game {

    private static final String DEFAULT_COLOR = "\u001B[0m";
    private final Iterable<Player> players;

    public Game(Iterable<Player> players) {
        this.players = players;
    }

    public void play() {
        //play a simulated number of turns
        int turns = 10;
        for (Player player : players) {
            System.out.format("%s%s%s%n", player.getColor(), player.getName(), DEFAULT_COLOR);
            //simulate the end of a game
            if (--turns == 0) {
                ;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To show the game working with different player orderings, an example main method is provided that plays a game with each of the three different factories, and shows the different player orderings in the output.

```java
public class Example {

    private static String DEFAULT  = "\u001B[0m";

    public static void run() {

        Player[] players = new Player[]{
                new Player("Red","\u001B[31m"),
                new Player("Blue","\u001B[34m"),
                new Player("Green", "\u001B[32m"),
                new Player("Yellow", "\u001B[33m")
        };

        System.out.format("Forward%n");
        PlayerIteratorFactory factory = new ForwardSelectorFactory();
        play(factory, players);

        System.out.format("Reverse%n");
        factory = new ReverseSelectorFactory();
        play(factory, players);

        System.out.format("Random%n");
        factory = new RandomSelectorFactory();
        play(factory, players);

    }

    private static void play(PlayerIteratorFactory factory , Player... players) {
        Iterable<Player> iterable =  new PlayerIterable(factory, players);
        Game game = new Game(iterable);
        game.play();
    }
}
```
There is one standard PlayerIterable class that takes a PlayerIteratorFactory and an array of Players, and the Game class just uses the standard Java Iterable interface to get an iterator over the players, without needing to know which concrete implementation of the PlayerIteratorFactory is being used. In fact the Game class can work with any implementation of the Iterable<T> interface, so it is very flexible and reusable.

In this design.

- Separated the responsibility for selecting the next player to take their turn out of a Game class by allowing the Game class to use the standard Java `Iterable` and `Iterator` interfaces.
- Because the Game class just uses the standard Java `Iterable` interface, we can use any concrete implementation to provide any variation in player ordering as required.
- The `Iterable` interface requires us to create a new iterator every time we want to iterate over the players, so we created a `PlayerIteratorFactory` that creates different iterators over the players, and the PlayerIterable class uses the factory to create a new iterator every time the `iterator()` method is called.
- Therefore the variation in player ordering is controlled by the choice of concrete implementation of the PlayerIteratorFactory interface.

This is one of the main uses of the Abstract Factory (or Factory Method pattern). Where we used something like a Strategy to provide a variation in an algorithm, the Strategy had to be created first and then used repeatedly. If we need to create a new instance of something that varies, then the concrete implementation of the Factory controls which concrete type is created, and the client code just uses the Factory interface to create new instances as required.

The variation  is represented by the factory - different concrete factories produce different concrete implementations of an abstract type.
